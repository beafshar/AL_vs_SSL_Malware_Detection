# AL_vs_SSL_Malware_Detection
Enhancing Windows Malware Prediction through Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: An Active and Semi-Supervised Learning Comparative Analysis

# Malware Detection with Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning

Malware poses a pervasive threat to system security and global cybersecurity, demanding continuous vigilance and innovation in detection methods. Traditional signature-based approaches prove laborious and susceptible to concept drift. This study delves into the realm of Microsoft environments, where the demand for precise and efficient malware detection is critical.

## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning methodologies, specifically Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning, to enhance detection accuracy, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Using a Microsoft malware prediction dataset as the foundation, we anchor our investigation on robust models - Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Methodology

We employ techniques like uncertainty sampling, query by committee, self-training, and co-training to redefine the boundaries of malware detection. Meticulous data preprocessing and correlation exploration between features drive our methodology.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
  - Scikit-learn
  - Scikit-optimize (skopt)
  - xgboost
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib.pyplot
3. Place the Microsoft malware prediction dataset beside the code.
4. Create a directory named "Malware Prediction" to store the results.

## Usage

1. Open the "AL-SSL_malware_detection.ipynb" file.
2. Execute the notebook cell by cell to understand the workflow and methodology.
3. Adjust parameters and experiment with different configurations as needed. (Such as models, parameter grids, number of iterations, and budget limit.)
4. Analyze the results and evaluate model performance.
